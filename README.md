# Tethics Excellence Academy

### Part 1. Attractive school website

- #### The website is responsive, so on phone, laptop and other devices, it automatically changes some styles

* #### Their are slideshows at many places to represent the collective success of the school, they can be operated with the arrows

* #### All the images given to us have been used

* #### The website has been hosted

### Part 2. Dynamic parts

- #### Teachers can post information to the updates section of the website through the administration portal, explained in Part 3

- #### Admission form actually works and teachers can manage admissions also in the administration portal

### Part 3. Administration portal

- #### Teachers will be given 4 important credentials
- #### The first 2 test credentials are `admission`- Username and `admissions-password-this-is-tough-to-guess` as the password
- #### teachers can use this credentials in https://tethics-excellence.darshsikka.me/admin/login

- #### After logging in they can access all the admission requests

- #### Teachers can see and note down the details of the student they want to select

- #### teacher can click on the resolve button to automatically send a mail to the student, to the email the student had filled in the form

* #### The second 2 credentials are for updates,`updater` as the username and `updates-password-this-is-tough-to-guess` as the password

* #### Teachers can use them in https://tethics-excellence.darshsikka.me/admin/update-login

* #### After logging in, teachers will see another UI where they can easily fill up a form for the updates

* #### Adding an attachment is necessary, the teacher will have to attach a PDF/Image etc. in order for the update to be uploaded, else the form will not be subitted.

* #### In the password section, the teacher needs to type `updates-password-this-is-tough-to-guess`, the password that was earlier, to confirm they are allowed to post updates
* #### Now that the form has been properly filled up, the form will be submitted and a new update will be visible in the updates section

* #### Considering the teachers may not be interested in advanced technology, the portals have been kept simple, and teachers don't have to perform advanced actions on the data. All they have to do is login and be all set.
* #### Login was necessary to be added so that students don't figure out how to add updates without the permissio of teachers
